Goals of App

1.       Demonstrate the potential of decentralized energy in Calgary, with each DA as itâ€™s own micro gridded system, to help promote a future of renewable energy in Canada.
2.        Provide estimates of the number of solar panels that can be installed per building, their output in kilowatt hours, the Return of Investment and the total solar energy produced by DA. 
3.       Allow users to interact with the app with a Draw Tool, allowing custom areas to be created with solar statistics generated on the fly.
4.       Display the total potential energy generation of biogas and solar by DA using estimates of food waste production and solar panel efficiency.

**Assumptions and Calculations**

The application uses assumptions and averages to estimate the number of solar panels a building can support, the energy generated from these panels, installation costs and the Return Of Investment. For biogas, the average waste a person produces was used to calculate the total waste of a DA.

**Solar Panels**

The average area of a single solar panel was found to be 1.64 square meters. The total number of solar panels a building can support was then calculated by dividing the area of the building by the area of a single solar panel.

**Solar  Energy Output** 
Based on the solar panel dimensions used, a single solar panel typically produces 0.265 kilowatt hours (kWh). The total output per hour was calculated by multiplying the number of solar panels on a building by 0.265 kwh.

**Return Of Investment**

The equation used to determine the Return of Investment of solar panels was:
Total System Cost / Value of Electricity Generated / Average Electricity Usage

The total system cost was calculated by multiplying the average installation cost ($1750/kW) by the efficiency of a single panel (0.265kW) and the total number of panels installed. As of February 2017, the Alberta government created a rebate for solar panel installations on residential and commercial buildings that cut costs by 30%. This lowered the average installation costs from $2500/kW to $1750/kW.

The average value of electricity generated was found to be about $0.045/kWh for Alberta in March 2017. 

The average electricity consumption for a single detached home in Alberta was 8292 kWh per year.  

**Waste Output**

The average person produces 0.75 kilograms of waste per day. This value was multiplied by the population of each DA to determine the total waste generated by per day. 

**Biogas Conversion**

On average, 1 kg of biodegradable material can produce 0.4 cubic meters of biogas. The total biogas produced by a DA was calculated by multiplying the total daily waste of a DA by 0.4 cubic meters.

**Energy from Biogas**

1 cubic meter of biogas can generate 6 kWh of usable energy. The total usable energy from biogas of each DA was calculated by multiplying the total biogas of that DA by 6 kWh.
