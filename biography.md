**Matthew Brown**

I am a first-year master’s Candidate in the Geography program at McMaster. This is my second time participating in the app challenge. Since last year’s challenge, I’ve been self-teaching myself programming, so I hope to apply my skills this year. Having just attended the Esri DevSummit, I have a lot of new app ideas that I can’t wait to apply! May the best team win!
